This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.4.

## Problem Statement
1. Create a form with 3 input,1 dropdown fields and 1 filed which will take date and
a button. Create a text box for searching the values from the array.
2. The drop down filed values should display on initialization using services.
3. The input and the dropdown fields should use two-way binding. Create a model
for the fields and initialize them on ngOnInit()
4. Create a service for sending the data and retrieving the data.
5. Create a function which will bind with the (ngSubmit). Once you click that button
it should send the data in the parameter and it should display the data in View. Use
pipe to show the date in 9/3/2010 this format.
6. Create a custom pipe to capitalize the first character of the any one of the input in
the View
7. Create a custom pipe for searching the values from the array as you enter the
values in the search text box.
8. Create a file in which define the routing configuration and define routeroutlet.
9. Divide the file for adding the data and for viewing the data.
10. Define path and assign component accordingly.
11. Define default and wildcard routes.
12. Create a navbar with two text values and clicking on those values the page
should routes accordingly.
